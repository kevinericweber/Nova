Exploratory repo for blazor, speech-to-text-to-speech, and possibly AI.

Mostly for kicks, but main long term goal is to get a blazor app that will be a sort of terse vesion of alexa/siri/etc.


Current Short/Mid TODO List
---------------------------

Get POST handling of requests - it doesn't look like the javascript post send is makign it into the SaveAudio.cs - probably due to difference in blazor versions between this and template project

Get POST handling to handle audio in memory without doing any saves

Look into NuGet audio-to-text libraries.
